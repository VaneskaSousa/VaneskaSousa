### Hi there 👋

My name is Vaneska Sousa, my pronouns are **she/her**. I have been on I.T since 2015 and currently **I'm Project Manager at [Instituto Atlântico](https://www.atlantico.com.br/)**. 

:rocket: From 2017 to 2019 I created a tool named Escolarize to optimize the teaching and learning process through gamification with 4 other developers friends. I am very proud of this project and I want to contribute in what I can to improve education, especially for social minorities. :blue_heart: :purple_heart: Unfortunately this work was shelved in 2019 and I hope to turn it into academic articles. So if you are also passionate about this issue, come together, maybe together we can contribute!
