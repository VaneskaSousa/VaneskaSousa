### Hi there 👋

My name is Vaneska Sousa, my pronouns are **she/her**. I have been studying software development since 2015 but I am currently focusing on developing myself in project management and tech community management. 

:rocket: In 2017 until 2019 I created a tool to optimize the teaching and learning process through gamification with 4 other developers friends called [Escolarize](http://escolarize.com). I am very proud of this project and I want to contribute in what I can to improve education, especially for social minorities. :blue_heart: :purple_heart:
